# 📚 Development Practices Manual

## Introduction
Welcome to the Development Practices Manual. Our goal is to standardize software development practices, enhance code quality, and establish guidelines for future projects without altering the existing ones.

## Checkpoints
Before merging any changes with the production branches of our applications, the guidelines in this manual must be reviewed.

## Feedback, Improvements, and Changes
If you identify better options for our development process, updates in framework versions, language usage, editorial errors, or new guidelines, please submit a pull request to the main branch.

## Current Versioning
This manual will evolve over time. We'll maintain releases starting from version 0.1.0, with continuous contributions from our team members. Our aim is to develop a robust document that provides a clear direction for the development process within the Altum group.
